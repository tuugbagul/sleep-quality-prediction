## 📊 Project Overview

Poor sleep quality affects health, productivity, and overall well-being.  
This project explores sleep patterns and predicts sleep quality using machine learning techniques.

### ✔️ Main objectives:
- Understand key factors influencing sleep quality  
- Perform data cleaning and missing value handling  
- Visualize feature relationships and distributions  
- Build ML classification models to predict sleep quality  
- Evaluate model accuracy and compare algorithms

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Normalizing continuous variables  
- Detecting & analyzing outliers  
- Splitting data into training/test sets

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA includes:

- Sleep disorder categories  
- Age distribution  
- Physical activity levels  
- Visual relationships (pairplots, heatmaps, histograms)  
- Statistical summary of all features  

All charts are stored in the `images/` directory.
